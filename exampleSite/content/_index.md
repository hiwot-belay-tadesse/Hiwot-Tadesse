## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/profile.png" alt="avatar">}}

Hi there! I’m Hiwot Belay, a Ph.D. student at Harvard’s Data to Actionable Knowledge Lab, advised by Finale Doshi-Velez.
Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Benedict College. I also spent some time at IBM Research as a research software engineer.

## Research Interest
My research focuses on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on developing transparent and trustworthy explanations for machine learning models. I’m particularly interested in designing explanation methods that adapt to the needs of the end user, and that support understanding and more informed decision-making.
